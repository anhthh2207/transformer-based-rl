# Transformer-based Reinforcement Learning

Final Project COMP2050 - VinUniversity

**Team**: Tran Quoc Bao, Tran Huy Hoang Anh, Le Chi Cuong

**Description**: We reimplement three SOTA reinforcement learning models including Decision Transformer, Trajectory Transformer, and Conservative Q-Learning. Then, they are tested on different games on the Gymnasium environment to compare their performance.
